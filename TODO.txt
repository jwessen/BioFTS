* Think about the sign in V inverse for yukawa potential
* Check that the polyampholyte example reproduces the MiMB chemical potentials
* Figure out if fields can be shifted to fluctuations around MFT saddle do reduce numerical errors in chain porpagators.
* CL integrator, noise should be an array. Should be able to turn off noise only for certain fields.
